# Baby Alien Genetics Lab

Interactive DNA Day activity for middle schoolers that simulates inheritance of traits using coin flips. Build baby aliens by flipping coins for each trait, then match genotypes to phenotypes and earn points for correct answers.

## 🚀 Features

- **Trait Simulation**: Flip two virtual coins per trait to determine the child’s genotype (heterozygous parents).
- **Phenotype Selection**: Choose the resulting physical trait based on genotype; correct answers trigger confetti and score updates.
- **Replayable**: Reset the game at any time with the **Replay** button.
- **Educational Flip-Cards**: Six interactive flip-cards presenting key genetics concepts (alleles, dominant vs recessive, etc.).
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Bootstrap for mobile-friendly layout.
